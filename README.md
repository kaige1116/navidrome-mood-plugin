# navidrome-mood-plugin

A [Navidrome](https://www.navidrome.org/) plugin that creates mood-based playlists using real audio analysis. It uses [essentia-tensorflow](https://essentia.upf.edu/) with Discogs-EffNet embeddings to analyze your music library for mood, energy, BPM, and danceability, then automatically generates and refreshes 13 mood playlists.

Works with any Subsonic-compatible client (Symfonium, Sublime Music, etc.).

## Features

- **13 Mood Playlists** — 6 simple moods + 7 composite scenario playlists, all auto-created and refreshed
- **Mood-Aware Instant Mix** — Replaces the default Instant Mix with mood-similarity matching (Euclidean distance across mood vectors)
- **Scheduled Analysis** — Periodically scans your library for new tracks and sends them to the analyzer
- **Scheduled Refresh** — Regenerates mood playlists on a cron schedule so they evolve as your library grows
- **Fully Configurable** — Mood thresholds, playlist sizes, analysis/refresh schedules, and analyzer URL are all configurable from Navidrome's plugin settings UI

### Mood Playlists

**Simple moods** — single score above a configurable threshold:

| Playlist | Based on | Default Threshold |
|----------|----------|-------------------|
| Happy Mix | mood_happy | 0.55 |
| Chill Mix | mood_relaxed | 0.55 |
| Energetic Mix | danceability | 0.6 |
| Melancholy Mix | mood_sad | 0.45 |
| Party Mix | mood_party | 0.55 |
| Aggressive Mix | mood_aggressive | 0.45 |

**Composite moods** — multiple conditions that must all be true:

| Playlist | Conditions | Sorted by |
|----------|-----------|-----------|
| Study Mix | relaxed >= 0.45, energy < 0.15, aggressive < 0.2 | relaxed |
| Workout Mix | danceability >= 0.55, energy >= 0.12, BPM >= 120 | energy |
| Sleep Mix | relaxed >= 0.5, energy < 0.08, BPM < 100 | relaxed |
| Road Trip Mix | happy >= 0.4, danceability >= 0.45, energy >= 0.1 | happy |
| Cooking Mix | happy >= 0.35, relaxed >= 0.3, danceability >= 0.3, aggressive < 0.2 | danceability |
| Dining Mix | relaxed >= 0.4, happy >= 0.3, energy < 0.15, aggressive < 0.15 | relaxed |
| Background Mix | relaxed >= 0.35, energy < 0.12, party < 0.3, aggressive < 0.2 | relaxed |

## Documentation

For detailed setup instructions, full configuration reference, troubleshooting, and monitoring guidance, see **[HELP.md](HELP.md)**.

## Quick Start

### 1. Start the Analyzer Service

The plugin needs an external service to perform audio analysis (essentia can't run inside WASM). A ready-to-use Docker image is included:

```bash
cd analyzer-service
docker build -t mood-analyzer .
docker run -d \
  --name mood-analyzer \
  -p 8000:8000 \
  -v /path/to/your/music:/music:ro \
  mood-analyzer
```

Or add it to your existing `docker-compose.yml`:

```yaml
mood-analyzer:
  build:
    context: ./analyzer-service
  container_name: mood-analyzer
  volumes:
    - /path/to/your/music:/music:ro
  restart: unless-stopped
```
or using the published image of the latest release with:
```yaml
mood-analyzer:
  image: ghcr.io/RFLundgren/mood-analyzer:latest
  container_name: mood-analyzer
  volumes:
    - /path/to/your/music:/music:ro
  restart: unless-stopped
```
The music path must match what Navidrome sees — the analyzer reads the same audio files.

### 2. Install the Plugin

1. Download `mood-playlists.ndp` from [Releases](https://github.com/craiglush/navidrome-mood-plugin/releases) (or [build from source](#building-from-source))
2. Copy it to your Navidrome plugins directory: `<navidrome-data>/plugins/`
3. Restart Navidrome (or it auto-loads if `ND_PLUGINS_AUTORELOAD=true`)
4. Go to **Settings > Plugins > Mood Playlists** and approve permissions
5. Set the **Analyzer Service URL** to your analyzer (e.g., `http://mood-analyzer:8000`)

### 3. Done

The plugin will:
- Analyze unanalyzed tracks daily at 2 AM (configurable)
- Refresh all 13 mood playlists weekly on Sunday at 3 AM (configurable)
- Return mood-similar tracks when you use Instant Mix on any analyzed track

## Requirements

- **Navidrome** `develop` branch (plugin support requires 0.61.0+)
- **Docker** (for the analyzer service)
- Navidrome config:
  ```yaml
  ND_PLUGINS_ENABLED: "true"
  ND_PLUGINS_AUTORELOAD: "true"  # optional but recommended
  ```

## Analyzer Service

The analyzer service (`analyzer-service/`) is a lightweight FastAPI app that wraps essentia-tensorflow. It exposes a single endpoint:

```
POST /api/analysis/file
Content-Type: application/json

{"file_path": "/music/Artist/Album/Track.m4a"}
```

Response:
```json
{
  "file_path": "/music/Artist/Album/Track.m4a",
  "title": "Track Name",
  "artist": "Artist Name",
  "album": "Album Name",
  "bpm": 120.0,
  "danceability": 0.75,
  "mood_happy": 0.82,
  "mood_sad": 0.15,
  "mood_relaxed": 0.45,
  "mood_aggressive": 0.10,
  "mood_party": 0.68,
  "energy": 0.55
}
```

The Docker image (~500MB) includes:
- `essentia-tensorflow` with pre-trained Discogs-EffNet embedding model
- 6 mood classification heads (happy, sad, relaxed, aggressive, party) + danceability
- BPM and energy extraction
- Genre/BPM-aware context boosts (see below)

You can also use any custom service that implements this API.

### Context-Aware Scoring

Raw essentia scores are adjusted using track metadata for better accuracy. Without this, genres like Drum & Bass score near-zero on danceability despite being inherently danceable.

**Genre boosts** — 25+ genre keywords nudge scores based on the track's genre tag:

| Genre | Adjustments |
|-------|-------------|
| DnB / Jungle / Drum & Bass | danceability +0.35, party +0.15, aggressive +0.10 |
| Dance / House | danceability +0.20, party +0.10 |
| Techno | danceability +0.25, party +0.15, aggressive +0.10 |
| Metal | aggressive +0.25, relaxed -0.15 |
| Ambient / Downtempo | relaxed +0.20, aggressive -0.10 |
| Disco / Funk | danceability +0.20, party +0.15, happy +0.10 |
| Pop | happy +0.05, danceability +0.05 |
| Blues / Emo | sad +0.10–0.15 |

**BPM correction** — DnB is often detected at half-time (86 BPM instead of 172). Tracks with 80–95 BPM in DnB/Jungle genres are corrected to double-time, which triggers a +0.20 danceability boost for the 140–180 BPM range.

## Configuration

All settings are configurable from Navidrome's plugin settings UI:

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| Analyzer Service URL | `http://mood-analyzer:8000` | URL of the mood analyzer HTTP service |
| Auto-Analyze | `true` | Automatically analyze new tracks on schedule |
| Analysis Schedule | `0 2 * * *` | Cron expression (default: 2 AM daily) |
| Playlist Refresh Schedule | `0 3 * * 0` | Cron expression (default: 3 AM Sundays) |
| Tracks per Playlist | `30` | Number of tracks in each mood playlist (applies to all 13) |
| Similar Songs Count | `20` | Tracks returned for Instant Mix |
| Happy Threshold | `0.55` | Minimum score (0-1) for happy classification |
| Chill Threshold | `0.55` | Minimum score for chill/relaxed |
| Energetic Threshold | `0.6` | Minimum score for energetic/danceable |
| Party Threshold | `0.55` | Minimum score for party |
| Melancholy Threshold | `0.45` | Minimum score for sad/melancholy |
| Aggressive Threshold | `0.45` | Minimum score for aggressive |

Note: Composite mood conditions (Study, Workout, etc.) are not configurable via the UI — they use fixed thresholds tuned for their specific scenarios. The simple mood thresholds above remain fully adjustable.

```

1. **Analysis** — On schedule, the plugin iterates all tracks via Subsonic API, sends unanalyzed ones to the analyzer service, and stores mood scores in its KVStore. The analyzer extracts raw audio features via essentia-tensorflow, then applies genre/BPM context boosts so that genre-specific characteristics (like DnB's danceability) are properly reflected.

2. **Playlists** — On the refresh schedule, it queries stored mood data and creates two types of playlists:
   - **Simple moods** — selects tracks above a single threshold (sorted by that score)
   - **Composite moods** — selects tracks matching ALL conditions (e.g., Study requires high relaxation AND low energy AND low aggression), sorted by a primary score field

3. **Instant Mix** — When triggered on a track, calculates Euclidean distance between the source track's mood vector and all analyzed tracks, returning the closest matches.
